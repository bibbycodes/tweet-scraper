AGORAS CODE-FOR-MONEY MARKET
Eliminating the trust problem between programmers and entities who hire them. Can publish a smart contract that whoever supplies a code with a proof that it meets given requirements, wins coins automatically. Thanks to Tau language, such proofs can be trusted.

COMPUTATIONAL RESOURCES MARKET
Everyone will be able to rent out their computational resources (CPU, GPU, Disk) and get paid for it. Lack of many computers is a major bottleneck in many fields (especially medicine design) and cloud/supercomputing companies cannot compete with the higher quantity and lower cost that home computers can offer.

DECENTRALIZED SMART SEARCH ENGINE
With large enough network, Tau can crawl the web overnight. We will have a self-incentivizing search engine such that the data is shared by everyone and supporting nodes get paid.

Agoras will allow smart contracts, that you can know their consequences beforehand. That thanks to the decidability of Tau-Chain.s language. Will also support true peer-to-peer contracts: business that need a private arena, can take place between two Agoras clients.

Agoras smart currency is on presale now. There is a total amount of 42,000,000 intermediate coins (IDNI Agoras Tokens), that represent 100% of future Agoras coins.
Starting from 01/05/2016 the price of one IDNI Agoras Tokens will be 20 cents (USD), going up 5% monthly.
'Premine' for long-term development and 3rd party partners is 3%.

1) A framework for existing ToR relays to receive cryptocurrency rewards in our native currency, ATOR,
 in accordance with their cumulative useful uptime, through a Proof-of-Uptime mechanism 

2) The introduction of the AirTor Router Hotspot, a handheld device that enables users to connect their consumer devices, via WiFi, and route all their web traffic through ToR script-free 

3) The rollout of the AirTor Relay, our own version of the ToR relay. It is designed for ToR routing and immediately interoperable with our ATOR Proof-of-Uptime framework, allowing non-technical users to 'mine' ATOR and contribute to web anonymity through ToR. Vision AirTor is dedicated to complete internet privacy. Though ToR can obscure a user's IP address from intermediary and destination routers, it does not entirely protect them from their Internet Service Provider (ISP) who can infer that they used ToR. Hence, the AirTor ecosystem eventually aims to empower users to replace part or all of their web-traffic route with Long-Range Radio (LoRa), through specialised hardware, to provide a new layer of physical independence. Our name summarizes this eventual vision of internet-independence, but AirTor believes evolution is revolution; our tech will add value at every stage and complement existing protocols to have the greatest positive impact.","DePIN, Privacy Coins, Ethereum Ecosystem",,,,,

Introduced as a ""joke currency"" on 6 December 2013, Dogecoin quickly developed its own online community and reached a capitalization of US$60 million in January 2014. Compared with other cryptocurrencies, Dogecoin had a fast initial coin production schedule: 100 billion coins were in circulation by mid-2015, with an additional 5.256 billion coins every year thereafter. As of 30 June 2015, the 100 billionth Dogecoin had been mined. 

Dogecoin was created by Billy Markus from Portland, Oregon and  Jackson Palmer from Sydney, Australia. Both wanted to create a fun cryptocurrency that will appeal beyond the core Bitcoin audience. Dogecoin is primarily used as a tipping system on Reddit and Twitter where users tip each other for creating or sharing good content. The community is very active in organising fundraising activities for deserving causes.

The developers of Dogecoin haven’t made any major changes to the coin since 2015. This means that Dogecoin could get left behind and is why Shibas are leaving Dogecoin to join more advanced platforms like Ethereum. One of Dogecoin strengths is its relaxed and fun-loving community. However, this is also a weakness because other currencies are way more professional.

To purchase Dogecoin, it involves downloading a crypto wallet, setting up a crypto exchange account and then trading away for your desired crypto currency. Once we have set up an account with a DOGE currency exchange and deposited some funds, you are ready to start trading.

PUMP,7,3,pumpopoly,0,,"Pumpopoly is a virtual real estate simulator reminiscent of classic real estate board games. Playable on all devices, the game features pixel art on an animated HTML5 canvas. The design objectives are simple: Provide players and promoters a fun and entertaining way to collect tokens passively.

Player movement:
Players collect a salary from the treasury on every move. However, if they arrive at another player's land they must pay rent to the owner for the privilege of parking. Parking is free at all lands owned by the City of Pumpopolis.

Philosophy:
Pumpopoly features a dynamically expanding game world. Land is an unending resource for players to improve upon. New city owned land is added an exponentially higher price for your satisfaction. Pumpopoly's dynamic game expansion ensures that in-game movements always have a lower average cost relative to the salary provided by the treasury.

Buildings:
There are currently five property types within the game: vacant, hovel, small townhouse, large townhouse and executive tower. All property types have 256 pixel art variations. City lands are sold as vacant lots. Players may upgrade their land by building improvements. Each improvement provides an exponential increase in rent.

Level up:
Players must have a qualifying in-game credit score to build improvements on their land. In-game credit scores are determined by the number of lands owned and the total number of active invitees. Additionally, players earn 50% commissions on all city land purchased by their invitees.

Tokens:
Pumpopoly players can choose to sell their land on the in-game market or export their property to a non-fungible token. 

All purchases within the game are denominated in native PUMPOPOLY fungible tokens. PUMPOPOLY is issued solely from the game contract. Similar to land prices, the price of PUMPOPOLY tokens sold by the game contract increases at an exponential rate as they are issued.",,,,,,

ZETA,6,5,zetachain,569358325,5056281149,"What Is ZetaChain (ZETA)?

ZetaChain is a novel L1 that has chain-agnostic interoperability built-in (EVM-compatible, Cosmos/IBC, Bitcoin, Dogecoin, Tron, etc.). Developers currently use ZetaChain’s messaging capabilities to send data and native value (without wrapping assets) between any chains. ZetaChain will also support native smart contracts, which let developers build omnichain dApps that orchestrate funds across chains from a single contract.

Who Are the Founders of ZetaChain?

ZetaChain’s founder was an early Coinbase employee and one of the creators of Basic Attention Token (BAT). Investors include all major market makers, top exchanges, early Coinbase and Binance employees including Dan Romero, Sam Rosenblum, and John Yi, as well as major contributors to some of the industry’s most widely adopted protocols and well known funds, including Polygon’s JD Kanani. Advisors to the project include Coinbase’s first Head of People Nathalie McGrath who scaled the industry leading exchange from 10 employees to over 800, and Juan Suarez, who served as in-house counsel at Coinbase from 2013 to 2022.

What Makes ZetaChain Unique?

ZetaChain is a blockchain that connects everything. It enables interoperability between any blockchains or layers by providing cross-chain value transfer and message delivery, as well as native omnichain smart contract support. Applications built on ZetaChain — omnichain dApps (odApps) — can leverage liquidity and data on multiple networks and read and update state on all connected networks. ZetaChain’s native omnichain smart contract platform lets developers deploy contracts with the same ease as developing dApps for a single network like Ethereum, that orchestrate data and value across many or all chains. ZetaChain’s connectivity is chain-agnostic and can connect to and bring smart contract capabilities to even non-smart-contract chains like Bitcoin and Dogecoin.
